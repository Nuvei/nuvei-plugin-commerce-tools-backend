## DMN module

The Direct Merchant Notification Module acts as a vital interface for handling asynchronous notifications from Nuvei. These notifications relay important updates regarding payment status updates, including authorizations, charges, or refunds. Upon receipt of a notification from
Nuvei, the module diligently interacts with the commercetools platform, locating the relevant payment transaction and adjusting it accordingly to maintain coherence with Nuvei's updates.
