# Extension API module

The extension api module serves as a publicly accessible intermediary service facilitating communication between the commercetools platform and Nuvei. Upon configuring [commercetools HTTP API Extensions](#https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/api-extensions) to invoke the
Nuvei extension api module, the commercetools platform will remotely trigger the Nuvei extension api module for each payment creation.

- Refer to the [Integration Guide](./extension-api/docs/IntegrationGuide.md) for instructions on integrating your shop with this module.
- Refer to the [How to run](./extension-api/docs/HowToRun.md) the extension module.
